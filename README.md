**Two Datasets**

***P1 data***

It is solved used by finding optimal Decision Tree Classifier for the dataset.

The P1 folder has two files -
- P1.pynb - It is a Python Jupyter Notebook with full description about the solution method.
- P1.py -   To run the whole code of P1.pynb in one go.

***P2 data***

The P2 folder has two files -
- P2.pynb - It is a Python Jupyter Notebook with full description about the solution method.
